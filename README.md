## Description

The goal of this project was to create a command line program which would dynamically generate an HTML page that showed the user's team based on input provided by them. The user will provide information on the manager, then provide information on team members. This information will show up in cards on the HTML page that will have contact info for those team members. The questions are incorpoated via the Inquirer package while the testing is handled via the Jest package.
